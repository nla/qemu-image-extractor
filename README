                 The QEMU Disk Image Extractor Thing
          ==================================================

Hi there.  This is a collection of scripts for building QEMU, a
Linux kernel and initramfs for mounting disk images and extracting
data from them.  We run this inside a VM instead of loopback mounting
so that we can use patched versions of the kernel that support
additional filesystems without affecting the host server's kernel.

Requirements
------------

* Linux host machine
  - x86_64 (it should work on x86 but you'll need to hack it a bit)
  - gcc 4
  - NFS server

Building
--------

Unpack somewhere and run `make'.  Copy the contents of 'dist' somewhere 
useful, like /usr/local/qemu-image-extractor

Using
-----

The destination directory for the image to be extracted to must be 
exported over NFS.  Then run the sc
